## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Child agent processes now receive EOF on stdin instead of inheriting Delegate's own
  stdin. This prevents Codex runs launched from orchestrators with open stdin pipes
  from hanging before they emit output.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- Codex streaming events are now parsed by the run tracker. `item.started`, `item.completed`, `turn.started`, and `turn.completed` events surface `agent_message` text and `command_execution` tool activity from `codex` runs in snapshots and completion reports.

- `run-output --completion-report` recovers a completion report from the recorded child stdout stream when `completion-report.md` is absent and the run has finished. Recovered reports are reconstructed with the same event parser used during live tracking, and are marked `synthetic: true` with `source: "stdout.log"` in JSON output. Codex recovery only promotes an `agent_message` once the stream reaches `turn.completed`, so in-progress messages are never treated as a final report.

- Synthetic completion-report recovery is bounded and best-effort. Delegate reads only a limited stdout tail during recovery, including archived stdout, and reports a clean `missing_completion_report` error when no completed final message is available inside that recovery window.

- Display-side redaction now covers common credential shapes such as authorization headers, bearer/basic tokens, JWT-like strings, and common secret key-values in snapshots and run-output views.

- Prompt input from delayed stdin pipes is now accepted when no direct prompt or prompt file is supplied.

### Notes

- Releases before 0.1.3 predate this changelog.
